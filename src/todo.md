- board
  - fix logic for snapping
  - make deckframe a canvas object
  - make bricks spawn on deckframe and have two hover states
  - brickshape drawing needs to know about the spin state on the board
  - understand why `withBorrowedContext` makes things offset inside the `CanvasDraw` call
- handle
  - mousedowns and mouseups are sometimes dont respond,
    maybe has to do with not checking the resulting state until the next frame
- screen translation
  - zoom
- meeples
- other screens / devices
- crrf brick being weird
  - idk what this means
